## üöÄ Run Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and a package manager (either npm or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

   (Note: Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual repository information.)

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Or using yarn
   yarn
   ```

### Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server.

```
# Using npm
npm start

# Or using yarn
yarn start
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

The application follows a component-based architecture typical of React projects.

* **Components:** The UI is broken down into reusable components like `Header`, `Footer`, `CharacterList`, `CharacterCard`, `SearchBar`, and `Pagination`.

* **Routing:** The application uses a simple routing system to navigate between the main character list and a detailed view for a single character.

* **State Management & Data Fetching:** The app leverages React Query for managing and caching data from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). This library helps to handle loading, error, and success states efficiently.

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for all styling, providing a utility-first approach for rapid and responsive UI development.

* **Favorites:** Character favorites are managed using a custom hook (`useFavorites`), which persists the state in local storage.

## ‚ú® Next Steps

Here are some ideas for future improvements and features:

* **Add filtering by species:** Extend the search functionality to include filters for different species.

* **User authentication:** Implement user accounts and store favorites in a persistent database (e.g., Firestore) so they can be accessed from any device.

* **Improved UI/UX:** Refine the styling and add more animations to enhance the user experience.

* **Detailed episode information:** On the character detail page, list the episodes the character appeared in, with links to more information about each episode.

* **Add a "Theme Switcher":** Allow users to toggle between light and dark mode.
